/** A subclass of <code>RankingService</code> that updates players' ratings
  * after a specified number of results has been posted.
  * <p>
  * The Glicko-2 system works best when the number of pair-wise game results
  * posted in a rating period is moderate to large. That is, an average of at
  * least 10 to 15 results. To accomodate this, the <code>postResults()</code>
  * method ends the current rating period after an average number of pair-wise
  * game results have been posted for each player. This average number is 
  * specified by the <code>jrs.aveGamesPerPeriod</code> property.
