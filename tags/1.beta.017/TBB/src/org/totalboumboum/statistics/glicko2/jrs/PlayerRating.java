/** A class representing a player's rating, as computed by the ranking service.
  * <p>
  * The ranking service does not compute true ratings, but rather gives an
  * estimate of the player's rating in the form of a confidence interval. The
  * interval is specified by a <i>mean</i> rating, and a rating <i>deviation</i>
  * which expresses the uncertainty in the rating. Additionally, ratings are
  * assigned a volatility, which reflects how consistently the rating has 
  * changed over time.
